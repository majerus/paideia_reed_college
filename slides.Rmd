## Steps to (Most) Analyses

1. Formulate a scientific question
2. Collect data
3. Clean and manipulate data
4. Analyze data
5. Form conclusions & communicate them

We focus on 3 (dplyr) and 5 (ggplot).


## Data 
At its simplest, data should be presented in a data matrix.  Consider a data set of diamonds and their properties, and convert it to a `tbl` data frame.  
```{r}
diamonds <- tbl_df(diamonds)
diamonds
```



## Essense of Data Manipulation

Most data manipulations can be achieved by the following verbs on a data matrix:

1. `filter`: keep rows matching criteria
2. `summarise`: reduce variables to values
3. `mutate`: add new variables
4. `arrange`: reorder rows
5. `select`: pick columns by name

Each of these is a command from the `dplyr` package.  Type `?select` to view them all.  

## Basic Commands
For example, let's `filter` to only those diamonds are have "Ideal" cut
```{r}
filter(diamonds, cut == "Ideal")
```

## Basic Commands
You can _pipe_ commands into others using the `%>%` command, described as _then_.
```{r}
filter(diamonds, cut == "Ideal") %>% select(carat)
filter(diamonds, cut == "Ideal") %>% select(carat) %>% sum()
```

## Basic Commands
You can _pipe_ commands into others using the `%>%` command, described as _then_.
```{r}
filter(diamonds, cut == "Ideal") %>% select(carat) %>% sum()
```
Note the piping saves you from nesting your commands in a morass of parentheses:
```{r}
sum(select(filter(diamonds, cut == "Ideal"), carat))
```




## A Grammar of Graphics

_What is a statistical graphic?_  [Wilkinson (2005)](http://www.amazon.com/The-Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448) boils it down to

* `aes` aesthetic mappings of data to what we can perceive: color, size, and shape.  
* `geom` geometric objects: points, lines, bars, etc.
* `stat` statistical transformations to summarise data (smoothing lines, binning a histogram)
* `facet` how to break up data into subsets and display
* `scales` map values in data space to aesthetic space: drawing legends or axes
* Extras


## ggplot2 Package
We use the `ggplot2` package instead of R's base graphics

Strengths

* Make beautiful graphics very fast.
* Easy to update/modify plots.
* Make highly customized plots very efficiently.

Weaknesses

* No 3d plotting or dynamic plots (see `ggvis`).
* Can be difficult for unorthodox plots.
* Slower processing time.


## Building Plots by Layer
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
head(diamonds)
small <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ]
```
`small` is a random sample of 1000 of the diamonds.  





## Building Plots by Layer
Question: What is the relationship between the carat of diamonds and their price, when you're comparing diamonds of the same cut quality?

We build a plot layer by layer, where the layers are separated by `+` signs:

```{r, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=small, aes(x = carat, y = price, colour = cut)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  facet_wrap(~cut) + 
  ggtitle("First example")
```


## Building Plots by Layer
```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=small, aes(x = carat, y = price, colour = cut)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  facet_wrap(~cut) + 
  ggtitle("First example")
```

## Building Plots by Layer

1. Base of data + aesthetics: `ggplot(data=small, aes(x = carat, y = price, colour = cut))`
2. type of `geom` is points:  `geom_point()`
3. one facet per type of cut: `facet_wrap(~cut)`
4. scale on y-axis is log base 10: `scale_y_log10()`
5. more options: `ggtitle("First example")`

## Finally
There are many different types of `aes`, `geom`, `stat`, `scales` to consider:
[http://docs.ggplot2.org/](http://docs.ggplot2.org/).  For example:

* `geom_smooth`
* `geom_histogram`
* `geom_density`
* `geom_boxplot`
